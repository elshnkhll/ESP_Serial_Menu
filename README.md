This code is for both ESP32 and ESP8266.
It allows you to set up (configuration) parameters vie old style MENU UI using just a serial port. 
It works best when you are using Putty to cominicate with your bord, but will still function in Serial Monitor (of Arduino IDE). 
Or just simply use this browser based serial terminal.
